RateFu

Introduction goes here.

Install
======

Run the following command:
<pre>
	./script/plugin install git://github.com/joebva/rate_fu.git
</pre>
Create a new rails migration using the generator:
<pre>
	./script/generate rate_fu RateableModel
</pre>
This will create a migration file ('ratings' table) and a directory /app/views/ratings with a partial and a .rjs file. It will also move stars.gif to public/images.

Add this to all the models you want to be rate: (articles, photos, images)
<pre>
	acts_as_rateable
</pre>
Add this to all the models you want to rate things: (users, accounts, employees)
<pre>
	acts_as_rater
</pre>
Add this to the show view of each model you set as 'acts_as_rateable'
<pre>
	<% rating_stars :generate_css => true %>
	<div id="star_ratings_block">
	  <%= render :partial => "ratings/rating", :locals => { :rateable => @rateable } %>
	</div>
</pre>
The rating_stars method inserts inline css. This can be omitted if you move the styles into your css file.
